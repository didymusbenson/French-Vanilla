    {
      "number": "4.1",
      "title": "Unsporting Conduct — Minor Warning",
      "penalty": "Warning",
      "definition": "A player takes action that is disruptive to the tournament or its participants. It may affect the\ncomfort level of those around the individual, but determining whether this is the case is not\nrequired.",
      "examples": [
        "A. A player uses excessively vulgar and profane language.",
        "B. A player inappropriately demands to a judge that their opponent receive a penalty.",
        "C. A player appeals to the Head Judge before waiting for the floor judge to issue a ruling.",
        "D. A player throws their deck on the ground after losing a game.",
        "E. A player leaves excessive trash in the play area after leaving the table.",
        "F. A player fails to follow the request of a tournament official to leave the play area."
      ],
      "philosophy": "All participants should expect a safe and enjoyable environment at a tournament, and a player\nneeds to be made aware if their behavior is unacceptable so that this environment may be\nmaintained.",
      "additional_remedy": "The player must correct the problem immediately. Subsequent Unsporting Conduct — Minor\ninfractions, even for different offenses, will result in a Game Loss. If a Game Loss is issued for\nrepeated infractions, and it occurs at the end of a game, it is acceptable for the judge to apply the\npenalty to the next game instead.",

    {
      "number": "4.2",
      "title": "Unsporting Conduct — Major Match Loss",
      "penalty": "Match Loss",
      "definition": "A player takes action towards one or more individuals that could reasonably be expected to\ncreate a feeling of being harassed, threatened, bullied, or stalked. This may include insults based\non race, color, religion, national origin, age, gender, disability, or sexual orientation. Threats of\nphysical violence should be treated as Unsporting Conduct – Aggressive Behavior.\nIt is possible for an offender to commit this infraction without intending malice or harm to the\nsubject of the harassment.",
      "examples": [
        "A. A player uses a racial slur against their opponent.",
        "B. A player intentionally misgenders their opponent.",
        "C. A player takes inappropriate photos of another player without express permission.",
        "D. A player asks a spectator for a date, is denied, and continues to press the issue.",
        "E. A player purposefully obstructs another player with the intent of inducing physical\ncontact.",
        "F. A spectator uses social media to bully another player."
      ],
      "philosophy": "A safe environment is a basic expectation of any tournament attendee. Harassment undermines\nthe safety and integrity of a tournament. Players who purposefully create harmful or\nunwelcoming situations in a tournament are expected to immediately correct the behavior and\ndemonstrate remorse or be removed.\nBecause of the confrontational nature of this infraction, judges need to end any match in progress\nand separate the players. Care should be taken not to escalate the situation if at all possible. The\noffender will be removed from the area to receive the penalty, and education about why the\nbehavior is unacceptable regardless of excuse. They may need a few moments to cool down\nafterwards. Apologizing is encouraged, but the desire of the other individuals to not interact with\ntheir harasser must be respected.\nOfficials must investigate these matters as soon as they are brought to their attention. If they\ndetermine that the infraction does not meet the criteria for Unsporting Conduct – Major, it is still\nrecommended that the players be talked to to avoid future misunderstandings.",
      "additional_remedy": "The player must correct the behavior immediately. If the offense occurs at the end of a match, it\nis acceptable for the judge to apply the penalty to the next match instead.\nUpgrade: If the offense was committed with malicious intent, the player displays no remorse, or\nthe offense is repeated at a later time, the penalty is Disqualification and removal from the venue.",

      "title": "Unsporting Conduct — Improperly Determining a Winner Match Loss",
      "penalty": "Match Loss",
      "definition": "A player uses or offers to use a method that is not part of the current game (including actions not\nlegal in the current game) to determine the outcome of a game or match, or uses language\ndesigned to trick someone who may not know it’s against the rules to make such an offer.\nIf the player was aware that what they were doing was against the rules, the infraction is\nUnsporting Conduct — Cheating.",
      "examples": [
        "A. As time is called, two players about to draw roll a die to determine the winner.",
        "B. A player offers to flip a coin to determine the winner of a match.",

        "E. Two players compare the converted mana costs of the top cards of their libraries to\ndetermine the winner of a game at the end of extra turns.",

        "G. A player says “Oh no, we’re going to draw, that’s terrible for us. If only there were\nsomething we could do about it.”"
      ],
      "philosophy": "Using an outside-the-game method to determine a winner compromises the integrity of the\ntournament.\nMatches that result in a draw due to time are expected to be reported as such and are not\nexcluded from this penalty if the players use an illegal method to determine the outcome.",

      "title": "Unsporting Conduct — Bribery and Wagering Match Loss",
      "penalty": "Match Loss",
      "definition": "A player offers an incentive to entice an opponent into conceding, drawing, or changing the\nresults of a match, encourages such an offer, or accepts such an offer. Refer to section 5.2 of the\nMagic Tournament Rules for a more detailed description of what constitutes bribery.\nWagering occurs when a player or spectator at a tournament places or offers to place a bet on the\noutcome of a tournament, match or any portion of a tournament or match. The wager does not\nneed to be monetary, nor is it relevant if a player is not betting on their own match.\nIf the player was aware that what they were doing was against the rules, the infraction is\nUnsporting Conduct — Cheating.",

      ],
      "philosophy": "Players enter a tournament expecting that their materials will be protected. This does not absolve\nthe players from their responsibility to keep an eye on their possessions, but they should expect\nto be able to retain the product they began with or were given for the tournament. Other instances\nof theft not involving tournament materials are the responsibility of the Tournament Organizer,\nthough judges are encouraged to help in any way possible.",
