      "title": "Game Play Error — Missed Trigger No Penalty",
      "penalty": "No Penalty",
      "definition": "A triggered ability triggers, but the player controlling the ability doesn’t demonstrate awareness\nof the trigger’s existence by the first time that it would affect the game in a visible fashion.\nThe point by which the player needs to demonstrate this awareness depends on the impact that\nthe trigger would have on the game:\n• A triggered ability that requires its controller to choose targets (other than 'target opponent'), modes, or other choices made when the ability is put onto the stack: The controller must announce those choices before they next pass priority.\n• A triggered ability that causes a change in the visible game state (including life totals) or requires a choice upon resolution: The controller must take the appropriate physical action or acknowledge the specific trigger before taking any game actions (such as casting a sorcery spell or explicitly taking an action in the next step or phase) that can be taken only after the triggered ability should have resolved. Note that passing priority, casting an instant spell or activating an ability doesn’t mean a triggered ability has been forgotten, as it could still be on the stack.\n• A triggered ability that changes the rules of the game: The controller must acknowledge the trigger or stop an opponent who tries to take any resulting illegal action.\n• A triggered ability that affects the game state in non-visible ways: The controller must make the change known by the first time the change has an effect on the visible game state. Once any of the above obligations has been fulfilled, further problems are treated as a Game Play Error — Game Rule Violation. If the turn-based action of putting a lore counter on a Saga is missed, it should be handled as though it was a missed trigger. 7 Triggered abilities that do nothing except create delayed triggered abilities automatically resolve without requiring acknowledgment. Awareness of the resulting delayed trigger must be demonstrated at the appropriate point. Triggered abilities that do nothing except create one or more copies of a spell or ability (such as storm or cipher) automatically resolve, but awareness of the resulting objects must be demonstrated using the same requirements as described above (even though the objects may not be triggered abilities). Abilities consisting of an action followed by “when you do” in the same ability are considered communicated by the announcement of the action. This is most commonly the case for exert and similar abilities. If a triggered ability would have no impact on the game, it’s not an infraction to fail to demonstrate awareness of it. For example, if the effect of a triggered ability instructs its controller to sacrifice a creature, a player who controls no creatures isn’t required to demonstrate awareness of the ability. Similarly, a player demonstrating awareness of an optional trigger with no visible effect is assumed to have made the affirmative choice unless the opponent responds. Judges do not intervene in a missed trigger situation unless they intend to issue a Warning or have reason to suspect that the controller is intentionally missing their triggered abilities. A player controlling another player is responsible for that player’s triggers in addition to their own.",
      "examples": [
        "A. Knight of Infamy (a 2/1 creature with exalted) attacks alone. Its controller says “Take two.”",
        "B. A player forgets to remove the final time counter from a suspended spell and then draws a card during their draw step.",
        "C. A player casts Manic Vandal, then forgets its triggered ability by not choosing a target for\nit. They realize this only after casting another spell.",
        "D. A player forgets to exile the Angel token created by Geist of Saint Traft at end of combat. They realize the error when declaring blockers during the next turn."
      ],
      "philosophy": "Triggered abilities are common and invisible, so players should not be harshly penalized when forgetting about one. Players are expected to remember their own triggered abilities; intentionally ignoring one may be Unsporting Conduct — Cheating (unless the ability would have no impact on the game as described above). Even if an opponent is involved in the announcement or resolution of the ability, the controller is still responsible for ensuring the opponents make the appropriate choices and take the appropriate actions. Opponents are not required to point out triggered abilities that they do not control, though they may do so if they wish. Triggered abilities are assumed to be remembered until otherwise indicated, and the impact on the game state may not be immediately apparent. The opponent’s benefit is in not having to point out triggered abilities, although this does not mean that they can cause triggers to be missed. If an opponent requires information about the precise timing of a triggered ability or needs details about a game object that may be affected by a resolved triggered ability, that player may need to 8 acknowledge that ability’s existence before its controller does. A player who makes a play that may or may not be legal depending on whether an opponent’s uncommunicated trigger has been remembered has not committed an infraction; their play either succeeds, confirming that the trigger has been missed, or is rewound. Players may not cause triggered abilities controlled by an opponent to be missed by taking game actions or otherwise prematurely advancing the game. During an opponent’s turn, if a trigger’s controller demonstrates awareness of the trigger before they take an active role (such as taking an action or explicitly passing priority), the trigger is remembered. The Out-of-Order Sequencing rules (MTR section 4.3) may also be applicable, especially as they relate to batches of actions or resolving items on the stack in an improper order. A triggered ability is considered to have triggered even if it was subsequently missed. Effects that count or restrict the number of times a triggered ability can trigger will count the missed one.",
      "additional_remedy": "If the triggered ability is an enters-the-battlefield trigger of an Aura that affects only the enchanted permanent and causes a visible change to that permanent, resolve the ability immediately. If the triggered ability is a delayed triggered ability that undoes a zone change (including token creation) caused by the effect that created the delayed triggered ability, the opponent chooses whether to resolve the ability the next time a player would get priority or when a player would get priority at the start of the next phase. The new zone does not need to be the same as the one the card was originally moved from. For all other triggered abilities, if the ability was missed prior to the current phase in the previous turn, instruct the players to continue playing. If the triggered ability created an effect whose duration has already expired, instruct the players to continue playing. If the triggered ability isn’t covered by the previous paragraphs, the opponent chooses whether the triggered ability is added to the stack. If it is, it’s inserted at the appropriate place on the stack if possible or on the bottom of the stack. No player may make choices for the triggered ability involving objects that would not have been legal choices when the ability should have triggered. For example, if the ability instructs a player to sacrifice a creature, that player can't sacrifice a creature that wasn't on the battlefield when the ability should have triggered. If the player is in the process of, or has just completed, an action that indicates the trigger has been missed, and completing that action would change the effect of the trigger, a simple backup may be performed on that action. Upgrade: If the triggered ability is usually considered detrimental for the controlling player and they own the card responsible for the existence of the trigger, the penalty is a Warning. The current game state is not a factor in determining this, though symmetrical abilities (such as Howling Mine) may be considered usually detrimental or not depending on who is being affected. 9",

      "title": "Game Play Error — Looking at Extra Cards Warning",
      "penalty": "Warning",
      "definition": "A player takes an action that may have enabled them to see the faces of cards that they were not entitled to see. This penalty is applied only once if one or more cards are seen in the same action or sequence of actions.",
      "examples": [
        "A. A player accidentally reveals (drops, flips over) a card while shuffling their opponent’s library.",
        "B. A player pulls up an extra card while drawing from their library.",
        "C. A player sees the bottom card of their deck when presenting it to their opponent for cutting/shuffling."
      ],
      "philosophy": "A player can accidentally look at extra cards easily and this infraction handles situations where a dexterity or rules error has led to a player seeing cards that they shouldn’t have. Cards in a library are considered to be there until they touch cards in another hidden set. Once those cards have joined another hidden set, the infraction is Hidden Card Error or Game Rule Violation. Players should not use this penalty to get a “free shuffle” or to attempt to shuffle away cards they don’t want to draw; doing so may be Unsporting Conduct — Cheating. Players also are not allowed to use this penalty as a stalling mechanism. The library is already randomized, so shuffling in the revealed cards should not involve excessive effort.",
      "additional_remedy": "If the cards were in the library, shuffle any previously unknown cards from a deck back into the random portion of the library, then put any previously known cards back in their correct locations.",

    {
      "number": "2.3",
      "title": "Game Play Error — Hidden Card Error Warning",
      "penalty": "Warning",
      "definition": "A player commits an error in the game that cannot be corrected by only publicly available\ninformation. It is not a Hidden Card Error if the opponent acknowledges the action or controls the continuous effect modifying the game rule that made the action illegal. This infraction only applies when a card whose identity is known to only one player is in a hidden set of cards both before and after the error. If an additional card is seen but not added to the set, the infraction is Game Play Error — Looking at Extra Cards. 10",
      "examples": [
        "A. A player draws four cards after casting Ancestral Recall.",
        "B. A player scries two cards when they should only have scried one.",
        "C. A player resolves a Dark Confidant trigger, but forgets to reveal the card before putting it into their hand.",
        "D. A player has more cards in their hand than can be accounted for.",
        "E. A player casts Anticipate and picks up the top four cards of their library.",
        "F. A player, going first, draws for their turn."
      ],
      "philosophy": "Though the game state cannot be reversed to the ‘correct’ state, this error can be mitigated by giving the opponent sufficient knowledge and ability to offset the error so that it is less likely to generate advantage. If cards are placed into a public zone, then their order is known and the infraction can be handled as a Game Rule Violation. Order cannot be determined from card faces only visible to one player unless the card is in a uniquely identifiable position (such as on top of the library, or as the only card in hand.) Be careful not to apply this infraction in situations where a publicly-correctable error subsequently leads to an uncorrectable situation such as a Brainstorm cast using green mana. In these situations, the infraction is based on that root cause. Information about cards previously known by the opponent, such as cards previously revealed while on the top of the library or by a previous look at the hand, may be taken into account while determining the set of cards to which the remedy applies. Always operate on the smallest set possible to remedy the error. This may mean applying the remedy to only part of a set defined by an instruction. For example, if a player resolves Collected Company, picks up three cards with one hand and then four cards with the other, the last drawn set of four cards should be used for the remedy, instead of the full set of seven cards..",
      "additional_remedy": "In cases where the infraction was immediately followed by moving a card from the affected set to a known location, such as by discarding, putting cards on top of the library, or playing a land, a simple backup to the point just after the error may be performed. If the set of cards that contained the problem no longer exists, there is no remedy to be applied. If the error put cards into a set prematurely and other operations involving cards in the set should have been performed first, the player reveals the set of cards that contains the excess and their opponent chooses a number of previously-unknown cards. Put those cards aside until the point at which they should have been legally added, then return them to the set. If the error involves one or more cards that were supposed to be revealed, the player reveals the set of cards that contains the unrevealed cards and their opponent chooses that many previously- unknown cards. Treat those as the cards that were ‘revealed’ and return them to the set that was 11 being selected from; the player then reperforms the action. If recreating the original selection set and reperforming the action would be too disruptive, leave the selected cards in hand. If a set affected by the error contains more cards than it is supposed to contain, the player reveals the set of cards that contains the excess and their opponent chooses a number of previously- unknown cards sufficient to reduce the set to the correct size. These excess cards are returned to the correct location. If that location is the library, they should be shuffled into the random portion unless the owner previously knew the identity of the card/cards illegally moved; that many cards, chosen by the opponent, are returned to the original location instead. For example, if a player playing with Sphinx of Jwar Isle illegally draws a card, that card should be returned to the top of the library. Upgrade: If a face-down card cast using a morph or disguise ability is on the battlefield during the game and does not have the relevant ability printed on the card, the penalty is a Game Loss. If the player has one or more cards with the same ability in hand, has not added previously unknown cards to their hand since casting the card found in violation, and has self-reported the error before an effect that would reveal it is played, the upgrade does not apply and they may swap the card for a card with the appropriate ability in hand.",

      "title": "Game Play Error — Mulligan Procedure Error Warning",
      "penalty": "Warning",
      "definition": "A player makes an error in one of the steps of the mulligan process. Once the mulligan process is complete and the game begins, excess cards arising from an improper mulligan is a Game Play Error — Hidden Card Error and too few cards is a Game Play Error — Game Rule Violation. Unintentional process errors that provide no advantage, such as declaring an intent to mulligan early or exiling too many cards to Serum Powder, are not an infraction.",
      "examples": [
        "A. A player draws eight cards at the start of the game (instead of seven).",

      "title": "Game Play Error — Game Rule Violation Warning",
      "penalty": "Warning",
      "definition": "This infraction covers the majority of game situations in which a player makes an error or fails to follow a game procedure correctly. It handles violations of the Comprehensive Rules that are not covered by the other Game Play Errors.",
      "examples": [
        "A. A player casts Wrath of God for 3W (actual cost 2WW).",
        "B. A player does not attack with a creature that must attack each turn.",
        "C. A player fails to put a creature with lethal damage into a graveyard and it is not noticed until several turns later.",
        "D. A Phyrexian Revoker is on the battlefield that should have had a card named for it.",
        "E. A player casts Brainstorm and forgets to put two cards back on top of their library."
      ],
      "philosophy": "While Game Rule Violations can be attributed to one player, they usually occur publicly and both players are expected to be mindful of what is happening in the game. It is tempting to try and “fix” these errors, but it is important that they be handled consistently, regardless of their impact on the game.",
      "additional_remedy": "First, consider a simple backup (see section 1.4).\nIf a simple backup is not sufficient and the infraction falls into one or more of the following\ncategories, and only into those categories, perform the appropriate partial fix:\n• If a player forgot to untap one or more permanents at the start of their turn and it is still the same turn, untap them.\n• If a player made an illegal choice (including no choice where required) for a static ability generating a continuous effect still on the battlefield, that player makes a legal choice.\n• If a player failed to draw cards, discard cards, or return cards from their hand to another zone, that player does so.\n• If an object is not in the correct zone, the exact object is still known to all players, and it can be moved with only minor disruption to the current state of the game, put the object in the correct zone. This only applies if the object being in the wrong zone is the Game Rule Violation, and not if it is the consequence of a different error.\n• If damage assignment order has not been declared, the appropriate player chooses that order. For each of these fixes, a simple backup may be performed beforehand if it makes applying the fix smoother. Triggered abilities are generated from these partial fixes only if they would have occurred had the action been taken at the correct time. Otherwise, a full backup may be considered or the game state may be left as is. 13 If the game has proceeded past a point where an opponent could reasonably be expected to notice the error, the opponent has also committed an infraction. In most cases, the infraction is Game Play Error — Failure to Maintain Game State. However, if the judge believes that both players were responsible for the Game Rule Violation, such as due to the opponent controlling the continuous effect modifying the rules of the game that led to the Game Rule Violation or a player taking action based on another player’s instruction, they have instead committed a Game Play Error — Game Rule Violation. For example, if a player casts Path to Exile on an opponent’s creature and the opponent puts the creature into the graveyard, once the game has continued both players will have committed a Game Rule Violation.",

      "title": "Game Play Error — Failure to Maintain Game State Warning",
      "penalty": "Warning",
      "definition": "A player allows another player in the game to commit a Game Play Error and does not point it\nout immediately. If a judge believes a player is intentionally not pointing out other players’\nillegal actions, either for their own advantage, or in the hope of bringing it up at a more\nstrategically advantageous time, they should consider an Unsporting Conduct — Cheating\ninfraction. Not reminding an opponent about their triggered abilities is never Failure to Maintain Game State nor Cheating.",
      "examples": [
        "A. A player’s opponent forgets to reveal the card searched for by Worldly Tutor. It is not noticed until the end of turn.",
        "B. A player does not notice that their opponent has Armadillo Cloak on a creature with protection from green."
      ],
      "philosophy": "If an error is caught before a player could gain advantage, then the dangers of the ongoing game state becoming corrupted are much lower. If the error is allowed to persist, at least some of the fault lies with the opponent, who has also failed to notice the error. 14",
