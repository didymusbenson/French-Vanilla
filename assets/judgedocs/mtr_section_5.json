      "title": "Bribery",
      "content": "The decision to drop, concede, or agree to an intentional draw cannot be made in exchange for or influenced by \nthe offer of any outside-the-game reward or incentive, nor may any in-game decision be influenced in this \nmanner. Making such an offer or enticing someone into making an offer is prohibited and is considered bribery. \nPlayers may not make any offers to tournament officials in an attempt to influence the outcome of a ruling. \nIt is not bribery when players share prizes they have not yet received in the current tournament and they may \nagree to such before or during their match, as long as any such sharing does not occur in exchange for any game \nor match result or the dropping of a player from the tournament. \nIt is not bribery when players in the announced last round of the single-elimination portion of a tournament agree \nto a winner and how to divide the subsequent tournament prizes. In that case, one of the players at each table must \nagree to drop from the tournament. Players receive the prizes according to their final ranking. \nThe result of a match or game may not be randomly or arbitrarily determined through any means other than the \nnormal progress of the game in play. Examples include (but are not limited to) rolling a die, flipping a coin, arm \nwrestling, or playing any other game. \nPlayers may not reach an agreement in conjunction with other matches. Players can make use of information \nregarding match or game scores of other tables. However, players are not allowed to leave their seats during their \nmatch or go to great lengths to obtain this information. \nPlayers in the single-elimination rounds of a tournament offering only cash, store credit, prize tickets, and/or \nunopened product as prizes may, with the permission of the Tournament Organizer, agree to split the prizes \nevenly. The players may end the tournament at that point or continue to play. All players still in the tournament \nmust agree to the arrangement. \nExample: Before the semifinals of a tournament (in which first place gets 12 packs, second place gets 8 packs and \n3rd and 4th get 4 packs each) begins, the players may get permission from the Tournament Organizer to end the \ntournament, with each player receiving 7 packs. \nExample: In the finals of a 1-slot Players Tour Qualifier that offers a travel award and an invitation to the winner, \nthe two finalists may agree to split the tournament prizes, but this agreement cannot alter the results of the match. \nOne player must drop from the tournament, leaving the travel award and the invitation to the player who did not \ndrop from the tournament. That player is then free to split the remainder of the prizes as agreed upon. The travel \naward and invitation are a single item and may not be split."

All incidents of unsporting conduct are subject to further DCI review."

At Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Level, players \nand spectators are expected to remain silent during the draft. \nSome of these restrictions may be waived due to official press or coverage; in these situations, the player will be \ninformed of the revised expectations. Teammates in certain team tournaments are also excepted from these \nrestrictions (see section 4.5)."
