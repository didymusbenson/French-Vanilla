Although it is beneficial, the Head Judge does not have to be certified.\n\nThe Head Judge’s responsibilities include: • Ensuring that all necessary steps are taken to deal with game or policy rule violations that they notice or are brought to their attention. • Issuing the final ruling in all appeals, potentially overturning the ruling of a floor judge. • Coordinating and delegating tasks to floor judges as needed.\n\nIf necessary, the Head Judge may temporarily transfer their duties to any judge if they are unable to fulfill them for a period of time. Also, in exceptional circumstances, if the tournament’s integrity would be damaged otherwise, the Tournament Organizer may replace the Head Judge.\n\nCertain Premier tournaments have multiple Head Judges and/or different Head Judges for different portions of the tournament.

At Regular Rules Enforcement Level, the judge may assist the player in understanding the game state in the interest of education. If a player wishes to ask their question away from the table, the request will usually be honored. Players may not request specific judges to answer their calls but may request a tournament official to help translate. This request may be honored at the discretion of the original judge.\n\nJudges do not intervene in a game to prevent illegal actions but do intervene as soon as a rule has been broken or to prevent a situation from escalating."

Most tournaments are run at this level unless they offer sizeable prizes or invitations. Players are expected to know most of the game rules, may have heard of policy and what is “really bad,” but generally play in a fashion similar to the way they do casually. Players are still responsible for following the rules, but the focus is on education and sportsmanship over technically precise play. Infractions in these tournaments are covered by the Judging at Regular Rules Enforcement Level document, located at https://wpn.wizards.com/en/rules-documents.\n\nCompetitive\n\nCompetitive tournaments are usually those with significant cash prizes or invitations awarded to Professional tournaments. Players are expected to know the game’s rules and be familiar with the policies and procedures, but unintentional errors are not punished severely. These are tournaments that protect the interests of all players by providing tournament integrity while also recognizing that not all players are intimately familiar with Professional-level tournament structure, proper procedures, and rules. Infractions in these tournaments are covered by the Magic Infraction Procedure Guide, located athttps://wpn.wizards.com/en/rules-documents. Professional\n\nProfessional level tournaments offer large cash awards, prestige, and other benefits that draw players from great distances. These tournaments hold players to a higher standard of behavior and technically-correct play than Competitive tournaments.
